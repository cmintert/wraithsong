Here I muse on the data structure for my little project.

1. Map 

The map will be structured in a way that a Map Object will contain Unit, Terrain and other Objects
and arrange those objects on a hexgrid. Spatial calculations will be done with the map object.

2. Terrain

The Terrain class will define the nature of the terrain, movement characteristics and other information.
