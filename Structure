Here I muse on the data structure for my little project.

HexMap Class:

	Purpose: Represents the entire hex grid, keeps track of hex tiles and their contents.

	Attributes:

		grid: dictionary representing the hexes. Using a dictionary with qr(s) coordinates as keys
		width and height: Dimensions of the grid.
		Other metadata: E.g., name of the map, creator, etc.
	
	Methods:

		add_object(obj, q, r): Places an object on the hex specified by the qrs coordinates.
		remove_object(q, r): Removes an object from the specified hex.
		get_object(q, r): Returns the object at the specified hex.
		get_neighbors(q, r): Returns neighboring hexes.

		Utility methods for map manipulations (e.g., resize, rotate, etc.)


BaseObject Class:
	
	A base class from which other game objects (terrain, resource, unit, POI) inherit. This will ensure consistency in object handling.

	Attributes:

		id: Unique identifier for the object.
		type: Specifies the type of the object (terrain, resource, etc.).
		name: A descriptive name.
		Other metadata: E.g., description, owner, etc.

	Methods:

		Basic methods common to all objects (e.g., rename, describe).
		Specific Object Classes (e.g., Terrain, Resource, Unit, POI):
		Derived from BaseObject. These will add specific attributes and methods relevant to their type.

	For example:

	Terrain Class:

		Attributes: elevation, walkable, climate, etc.
		Methods: modify_elevation, change_climate, etc.
	
	Resource Class:

		Attributes: resource_type, quantity, extraction_rate, etc.
		Methods: extract, replenish, etc.

	Unit Class:

		Attributes: health, attack_power, movement_speed, etc.
		Methods: move, attack, defend, etc.
	
	POI Class:

		Attributes: importance, lore, associated_events, etc.
		Methods: explore, trigger_event, etc.
